# Count {{index . "task"}}

Write a function that reads the below text and returns the number of "{{index . "task"}}".

> "{{index . "text"}}"

The signature of the function should be `func counter(io.Reader) int`. The argument is an [`io.Reader`](https://pkg.go.dev/io#Reader), a basic I/O interface that supports a single method to read the above input text:

```go
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

You can solve the exercise by using the barebones `io.Reader` interface, but this will be a lot of work. To simplify dealing with buffered reads, Go provides lots of useful convenience packages in the standard library, like [`bufio.ReadString`](https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#Reader.ReadString) to read a buffer into a string until a delimiter (use [`bufio.NewReader`](https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#NewReader) to obtain a `bufio.Reader` from an `io.Reader`), [`strings.Fields`](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Fields) to split a string into a slice of strings on whitespace characters, and [`unicode.IsLower`](https://pkg.go.dev/unicode#IsLower) and [`unicode.IsUpper`](https://pkg.go.dev/unicode#IsUpper) to check whether a Unicode character is upper-case or lowercase, respectively. Use your best judgement to assemble these helpers into your own solution.
