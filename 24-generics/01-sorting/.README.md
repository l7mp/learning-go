# Sorting data

Write a function that receives a slice as its argument and returns a slice that contains the original values in ascending order (if the slice contains strings, sort from 'A' - 'Z').
The sorting should satisfy the following requirements:
- The function should work with slices of type *`{{ index . "type-one"}} and {{index . "type-two"}} }`* but is not required to work with other types
- You must not use type checking and the function must not accept a slice with type interface{} (hint: read the name of the parent directory :D)

An example for the usage:
{{ index . "example" }}

Place your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
