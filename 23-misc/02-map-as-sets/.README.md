# Search

Write a function that reads the below text and returns `true` or `false` if "{{index . "word"}}" appears in the text *more than once*, without respect to letter case (i.e., the each of words `Hello`, `heLLo`, and `HELlo` match for the search strings `HELLO` and `hello`).

> "{{index . "text"}}"

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` at the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

HINT: 
- Make sure to remove punctuation from the input (like `.`, `;`, or `?`) and trim the text to alphanumeric characters. For instance, you can use [`regexp.ReplaceAllString`](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.ReplaceAllString) with the regular expression `[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+`) for this purpose.
- You can use a `map[string]int` to remember the number of times a particular word is found while iterating through the text word by word.
