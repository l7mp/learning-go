# Basics

In this exercise, you'll build a game store plus a set of functions to query the store.

1. Declare the following structs:
   - `item`: `id` (int), `name` (string), `price` (int)
   - `game`: embed the `item`, `genre` (string)

2. Write a `newGame` function that takes an item id, name and price and returns a game filled with the data supplied.

3. Stringify items and games: write a `String` function with an `item` receiver to dump an item in the form `<id>: <name> costs <price>` and another `String` function with a `game` receiver to dump a game in the form `Game <id>: <name> costs <price> of genre <genre>`.

4. Write a `newGameList` function that creates a game slice using the following data:

   | id | name       | price | genre            |
   |----|------------|-------|------------------|
   | 1  | god of war | 50    | action adventure |
   | 2  | x-com 2    | 30    | strategy         |
   | 3  | minecraft  | 20    | sandbox          |

5. Write a `queryById` function that returns the game in a gamelist with the given id or an "No such game" error.

6. Write a `listNameByPrice` function that returns the name of the game(s) with price equal or smaller than a given price.
