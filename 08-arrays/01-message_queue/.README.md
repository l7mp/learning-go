# Message Queue

You have to implement a message queue that takes three inputs from different source channels and create an array that consists of the actual value of the inputs.

Write a small function that accepts three arguments, the three source channels. These are: `A`, `B` and `C` and each of them represented by a `string` value which is the actual message. The function should return an array of string, in which the order of the elements are the following:

`{ {{index . "chan" 0}}, {{index . "chan" 1}}, {{index . "chan" 2}} }`

Place your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
