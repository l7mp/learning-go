# Strings - Change the network mask in the given CIDR address

Write a small function, and change the network mask of the {{index . "cidr"}} CIDR address to {{index . "subnet"}} in the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`. Do not use additional variables, or modify the existing code.

Hint: Use strings.Split to split strings on an arbitrary delimiter.

CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated network mask. The notation was invented by Phil Karn in the 1980s. CIDR notation specifies an IP address, a slash ('/') character, and a decimal number. The decimal number is the count of consecutive leading 1-bits (from left to right) in the network mask.
