# Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number

Write a small `fibonacci(n int) int` function that returns the [n-th Fibnacci
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) for any `n`. Assume the Fibonacci sequence
starts with 0 and 1, i.e., `F(0) = 0`, `F(1) = 1`, `F(2) = 1`, `F(3) = 2`, and so on. 

For instance, the function should return 13 when called with the input 7, since the 7th Fibonacci
number is 13.

Hint: use recursion!
