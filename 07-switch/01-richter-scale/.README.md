# Describe an Earthquake on the Richter scale

Write a small function that returns the "{{index . "description"}}" of a magnitude {{index . "magnitude"}}) earthquake on the [Richter scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale) in the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`. Use the `switch` [statement](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/9) in your code.

Earthquake descriptions based on the magnitude:

| 2.0 and less than 3.0  | very minor  |
| 3.0 and less than 4.0  | minor       |
| 4.0 and less than 5.0  | light       |
