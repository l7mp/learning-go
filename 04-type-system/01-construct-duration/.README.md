# Construct duration from arguments

Write a small function that accepts two arguments, for example: ({{index . "arg1"}}, {{index . "arg2"}}) and constructs a time value based on them, where {{index . "arg1"}} is the number of {{index . "type1"}}, while {{index . "arg2"}} is the number of {{index . "type2"}}. The function should return the result as a `time.Duration`.
