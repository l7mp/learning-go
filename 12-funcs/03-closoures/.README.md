# Closures as proxy

In this exercise, you will create a **{{ index . "name" }} proxy** function.
The function should be called *proxy* and should satisfy the following criteria:
{{ index . "text" }}

It is important that you do not externalize the state of the function, instead use closures to accomplish a similar effect.
Just for clarity, here is an example usage of the proxy function.
{{ index . "example" }}
