# "Repaint" a variable to its complementary color

Write a function to change the value of the received color "{{index . "primary"}}" to its
complementary "{{index . "complementary"}}". Make sure the conversion works in both
directions. Return an empty string and an error if the function receives an unknown color.
Use the `fmt.Errorf()` to generate `error`.

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `//INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
