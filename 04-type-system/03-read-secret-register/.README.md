# Read secret device register

Consider a custom RF device that has `Channel Control Register` known as `CHAN_CTRL`. The register contains four fields, each of them has one-byte length.

Write a small function that accepts one argument: `CHAN_CTRL`, which has `uint32` type. The function should parse the register and return each the value of each field. The field order in the register is the following:

| **Bytes** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**    | **4**    |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Fields    | {{index . "pos" 0}} | {{index . "pos" 1}} | {{index . "pos" 2}} | {{index . "pos" 3}} |

You have to return the fields in this order: `TX_CHAN`, `RX_CHAN`, `RX_PCODE`, `TX_PCODE`. 

Example: if the parameter is `0x82ABBA19`, then `{{index . "pos" 0}} = 0x82`, `{{index . "pos" 1}} = 0xAB`, `{{index . "pos" 2}} = 0xBA` and `{{index . "pos" 3}} = 0x19`.

Place your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
